and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.28.0] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- rebranded the npm package from `@re-shell/cli` to `@umutkorkmaz/re-shell-cli`
- updated CLI self-update guidance, monorepo scaffolding defaults, and generated install instructions to use the new package scope
- repointed package metadata and documentation links to the personal GitHub repository

## [0.27.5] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- added a structured example library under `packages/cli/examples/` with task-focused guides for core workflows, workspace/config, API/codegen, services/tools/quality, plugins/data, cloud/k8s/observability, and security/collaboration/learning
- added an index for the new example library so users can jump to the right command group quickly
- publish the `examples/` directory with the CLI package so the new guides ship alongside the existing README and EXAMPLES reference

## [0.27.4] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- JSON commands now respect `NO_COLOR` and no longer emit color-environment warnings alongside machine-readable output
- workspace health diagnostics now render real newlines instead of literal `\n` escape sequences
- quality and tools framework listings now render closing dividers correctly instead of repeating single-character lines
- nested subcommand `--version` flags no longer trigger the global CLI version banner
- API docs and client commands now parse generated YAML OpenAPI specs correctly instead of assuming JSON-only input

## [0.27.3] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- React and React TypeScript workspace scaffolds now generate a Vite-compatible root `index.html` and `src/main.tsx`
- generated React/Vite apps now build successfully instead of failing on `src/main.tsx` entry resolution
- generated React/Vite dev servers now serve valid HTML on both `/` and configured app routes instead of falling into template/layout 404s

## [0.27.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- monorepo initialization now seeds new workspaces with `@re-shell/cli` `^0.27.0` instead of the stale `^0.2.5` range

## [0.27.1] - 2026-03-18

### Changed

- normalized the public CLI version line to `0.27.x` so package metadata matches the current npm update stream
- fixed the update notification rendering to use proper box layout instead of hard-coded ANSI-width padding

### Fixed

- `init --skip-install` no longer fails on missing package managers and now exits non-zero correctly for real init errors
- `create --dry-run` now performs a real preview without writing files
- `list --json`, `workspace health --json`, and `workspace optimize --json` now emit clean JSON on stdout
- workspace diagnostics score rendering no longer prints chalk function bodies
- `workspace conflict detect` now fails with actionable guidance instead of a raw runtime error when a workspace-definition file is missing or invalid
- integration test helpers now build the CLI with `npm run build` instead of assuming `pnpm` is on `PATH`

### Added
